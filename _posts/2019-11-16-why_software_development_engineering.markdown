After High School Graduation back in 2006, I decided I wanted to become a nurse. I was an immigrant from the Philippines and back then being a nurse is the shortest and easiest way to have a stable livelihood; however, that wasn't my passion. I love computers so much that I can just be in front of the computer from the time I wake up until I sleep for the next day--everyday. I then discovered robotics and fell in love almost immediately. Then I learned Java programming and I'm then certain that I love Software Engineering. 

Why Software Engineering? because there's just no limit on what you can do and what you can build from it. Everything can be built and there are million ways to do it. I love that small things adds up to something big. From a simple "Hello World" to something massive like AI. After graduating, I found out that there are different choices to start a career with a CS degree. I could build websites, games, applications both mobile and desktops, AI or Machine Learning--the option is just endless. This is why I love Software Development/Engineering because there is no limit and there are different options for career growth. 

I graduated from Cal Poly Pomona with a BS in Computer Science but unfortunately, job hunting for me was complex--plus having no experience at all hinders me to start my career as a Software Engineer. This is why I joined Flatiron School to jumpstart once again my love in Software Development and have something to show to my potential employers.

Lastly, why Software Development? Because I feel like a "God" creating from nothing to something.
